# GBcollage
In this project, we release tow collage layout datasets correponding to the 1080*1920 and 3840*2160 canvas sizes.

Additionally, our automated layout generation tool, CollageBuilder, is available at https://chi-demo.vercel.app/. Users can select from predefined Width and Height options: (225, 300), (256, 256), (440, 2390), (613, 719), (1080, 1920), (2560, 1080), and (3840, 2160). After paper review, we will enable functionality for any custom canvas sizes as required.
